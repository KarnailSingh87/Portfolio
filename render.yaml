# Render service definitions for Tamanna (example).

# Notes:
# - This file is a starter template. For production, set secrets and env vars in the
#   Render dashboard (Settings -> Environment). Do NOT store secrets in this file.
# - After creating the static sites, you'll get URLs for `tamanna-frontend` and
#   `tamanna-admin`. Use those values for `FRONTEND_URL` and `ADMIN_URL` in the backend
#   service environment variables so CORS and redirects work as expected.
